- **notebook**: Contains the Databricks notebook for web activity analytics.
- **data**: Stores sample data used in the analysis.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.

## Requirements

- Databricks account
- Spark environment
- Python

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anup3495/WebActivityAnalyticsDatabricks
    ```

2. Open the Databricks notebook (`notebook/Web_Activity_Analytics.ipynb`) in your Databricks environment.

## Usage

1. Run the notebook cells sequentially to analyze web activity data.
2. Explore optimization techniques and data quality monitoring.
3. Visualize insights using Matplotlib/Seaborn or Databricks built-in tools.

## Optimization Techniques

Explore advanced optimization techniques within the notebook:

- Schema optimization
- Partitioning
- Caching
- Broadcasting for joins
- Shuffling optimization

## Data Quality Monitoring

Ensure data quality through:

- Automated tests
- Setting up monitoring with Databricks Jobs

## Visualization

Visualize insights derived from the data:

- Matplotlib/Seaborn for local development
- Databricks built-in visualizations for collaborative exploration
